Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I specialise in International Relations. I earned my <a href="https://cir.uchicago.edu/">MA</a> in International Relations from the University of Chicago and <a href="https://ppaweb.hku.hk/">BSocSc</a> in Politics and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong.

My <a href="http://shinghon.github.io/research">upcoming research</a> explores the influence of member states in international organisations, with focus on China using computational text analysis. I have <a href="http://shinghon.github.io/publications">published</a> in <i>International Affairs</i>, <i>Journal of Global Security Studies</i>, and written in <i>The Washington Post</i>. Prior to PhD, I interned at ALPHA Toronto, an Indonesian fair trade <a href="https://therainforestcoffee.wordpress.com/">co-op</a>, East Asian Institute NUS, and UNDP China.
