Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, where I specialise in International Relations. I earned my [MA](https://cir.uchicago.edu/) in International Relations from the University of Chicago and [BSocSc](https://ppaweb.hku.hk/) in Politics and Public Administration from the University of Hong Kong.

My [upcoming research](http://shinghon.github.io/research) explores the influence of member states in international organisations, with focus on China using computational text analysis. I have [published](http://shinghon.github.io/publications) in the *International Affairs*, *Journal of Global Security Studies* and written in *The Washington Post*. Prior to PhD, I interned at ALPHA Toronto, an Indonesian fair trade [co-op](https://therainforestcoffee.wordpress.com/), East Asian Institute NUS and UNDP China.
